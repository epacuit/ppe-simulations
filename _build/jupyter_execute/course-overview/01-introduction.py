# ## Agent-Based Modeling
# 
# Agent-based simulations are used in many different areas: 
# 
# * Ross A. Hammond, [Considerations and Best Practices in Agent-Based Modeling to Inform Policy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK305917/), NCBI, 2015.
# 
# In this coure, we are focused on simulations used in Philosophy (especially Social Epistemology), Politics  and Economics: 
# 
# * Conor Mayo-Wilson and Kevin J.S. Zollman, The Computational Philosophy: Simulation as a Core Philosophical Method. [Preprint](http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/18100/), 2020.
# * J. McKenzie Alexander, The Structural Evolution of Morality. Cambridge University Press, 2007.
# * Mostapha Diss and Vincent Merlin (eds.), Evaluating Voting Systems with Probability Models: Essays by and in Honor of William Gehrlein and Dominique Lepelley. Springer, 2021.

# ## NetLogo
# 
# NetLogo ([https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/)) is a powerful framework for creating agent-based simulations.   It is a programming environment created in Java (although you do not need to know Java to use NetLogo).   
# 
# * There is a web version of NetLogo: [http://www.netlogoweb.org/](http://www.netlogoweb.org/)
# * With NetLogo you can quickly create an agent-based model with animation (e.g., see the [Schelling Model of Segregation](http://www.netlogoweb.org/launch#http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/models/Sample%20Models/Social%20Science/Segregation.nlogo)) 
# * There are a number of books written about NetLogo:
#     * Uri Wilensky and William Rand, [An Introduction to Agent-Based Modeling: Modeling Natural, Social, and Engineered Complex Systems with NetLogo](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Agent-Based-Modeling-Natural-Engineered/dp/0262731894/ref=sr_1_4?dchild=1&keywords=agent+based+modeling&qid=1611489846&sr=8-4), The MIT Press, 2015.
#     * Steven F. Railsback and Volker Grimm, [Agent-Based and Individual-Based Modeling: A Practical Introduction](https://www.amazon.com/Agent-Based-Individual-Based-Modeling-Practical-Introduction/dp/0691190836/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=agent+based+modeling&qid=1611489846&sr=8-3), Princeton University Press; 2nd edition (March 26, 2019).
# 

# ## Why not NetLogo? 
# 
# * Netlogo is its own programming language with its own quirks
# * Python is a standard tool used in AI, machine learning, and data science 
# * Access to powerful packages for scientific and mathematical computing (scipy, numpy, etc.)
# * Many different options for visualizing and sharing your simulations
# * While Netlogo makes animating the model easier, we do not always need to visualize the dynamics of an agent-based model
# 

# ## A Brief Introduction to Python (as needed)
# 
# > Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Pythonâ€™s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms. ([https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/))
# 
# * You don't need to understand everything at this stage!   
# * Python is an interpretted language. 
# * Python is dynamically typed.
