# ## Netlogo
# 
# NetLogo ([https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/)) is a powerful framework for creating agent-based simulations.   It is a programming environment created in Java (although you do not need to know Java to use NetLogo).   
# 
# * There is a web version of NetLogo: [http://www.netlogoweb.org/](http://www.netlogoweb.org/)
# * With NetLogo you can quickly create an agent-based model with animation (e.g., see the [Schelling Model of Segregation](http://www.netlogoweb.org/launch#http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/models/Sample%20Models/Social%20Science/Segregation.nlogo)) 
# * There are a number of books written about NetLogo:
#     * Uri Wilensky and William Rand, [An Introduction to Agent-Based Modeling: Modeling Natural, Social, and Engineered Complex Systems with NetLogo](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Agent-Based-Modeling-Natural-Engineered/dp/0262731894/ref=sr_1_4?dchild=1&keywords=agent+based+modeling&qid=1611489846&sr=8-4), The MIT Press, 2015.
#     * Steven F. Railsback and Volker Grimm, [Agent-Based and Individual-Based Modeling: A Practical Introduction](https://www.amazon.com/Agent-Based-Individual-Based-Modeling-Practical-Introduction/dp/0691190836/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=agent+based+modeling&qid=1611489846&sr=8-3), Princeton University Press; 2nd edition (March 26, 2019).
# 

# ## Why not Netlogo? 
# 
# * Netlogo is its own programming language with its own quirks
# * Python is a standard tool used in AI, machine learning, and data science 
# * Access to powerful packages for scientific and mathematical computing (scipy, numpy, etc.)
# * Many different options for visualizing and sharing your simulations
# * While Netlogo makes animating the model easier, we do not always need to visualize the dynamics of an agent-based model
# 

# # Schelling Segregation Model
# 
# 
# A famous model due to Thomas Schelling shows how global patterns of spatial segregation can arise from the effect of **homophily** operating at a local level.
# 
# **Homophily** is the principle that we tend to be similar to our friends and/or neighbors.
# 
# T. Schelling. Dynamic models of segregation. The Journal of Mathematical Sociology, 1(2), 143-186, 1971.
# 
# See also,
# * J. M. Sakoda, The checkerboard model of social interaction. The Journalof Mathematical Sociology 1(1), 119-132, 1971.
# 
# * R. Hegselmann, Thomas C. Schelling and James M. Sakoda: The intellectual, technical, and social history of a model. Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation 20 (3), 2017.
# 
# 

# 
# There are two components of the Schelling model: 
# 
# 1. A network representing different locations
# 2. A set of agents with two properties: 
#     1. The agent type (e.g., 'red' or 'blue')
#     2. The current position of the agent in the network
#

import networkx as nx
import random
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
grid = nx.grid_2d_graph(3,3)
color_map=list()
for node in grid:
    color_map.append('blue' if random.random() < 0.5 else 'red')
pos = nx.spring_layout(grid, iterations=100)
nx.draw(grid, pos, node_color=color_map, node_size=500, font_color='white', width=2, lw=1.5, with_labels=False)
plt.show()


# ## Dynamics
# 
# At each round: 
# 
# 1. For each agent $a$, determine the number of neighbors that are of the same type. 
# 2. Agent $a$ is happy if the number of similar agents is above a fixed threshold. 
# 3. If $a$ is not happy, then $a$  moves to an empty location.
# 
# Continue that process for a fixed number of rounds or until every agent is happy. 

# ## Questions
# 
# * How many agents are there? 
# * What is the structure of the network? 
# * How do you determine the neighbors of an agent? 
# * Is the homophily threshold the same for all agents? 
# * How densely populated is the network (how many free locations are there)?

# # Implementing Schelling's Model using Python in Mesa 

# ## A Brief Introduction to Python (as needed)
# 
# > Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Pythonâ€™s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms. ([https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/))
# 
# * You don't need to understand everything at this stage!   
# * Python is an interpretted language. 
# * Python is dynamically typed.
