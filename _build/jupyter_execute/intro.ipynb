    "Computer simulations have been used for almost as long as there have been computers.  The earliest scientific use of computer simulations were for physics and engineering. Increasingly people are also employing computer simulation to understand social behavior both in humans and other animals. This class is about the nuts and bolts of computer simulation of social behavior and about the underlying theory behind this work. The course also discusses the philosophical issues that arise when evaluating the use of computational and mathematical models in economics and philosophy. During the course, students will gain hands-on experience developing simulations in Python. Although some previous programming experience will be helpful, the course will be completely self-contained.\n",
